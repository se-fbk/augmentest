A Java project includes a class called `{{ class_name }}` with following fields:
`{{ fields }}`
and it has the following method details as JSON string:
`{{ focal_method_details }}`.
We need a test oracle for a JUnit test case based on the above information and DEVELOPER COMMENTS of the method along with any other relevant information you can find in the provided vectore store files to test its functionality.

In the following the test case, replace the `{{ assertion_placeholder }}` with an appropriate assertion:
```
{{ test_method_code }}
```
Just write the assertion statement for the placeholder, not the whole test. Your statement should end with a semicolon. No explanation or markdown formatting/tick needed.
