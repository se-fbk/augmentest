A Java project includes a class called `{{ class_name }}` with following fields:
`{{ fields }}`
and it has the following Focal method details as JSON string:
`{{ focal_method_details }}`.

The class has other methods with developer comments as JSON string:
`{{ class_method_details }}`.

We need a test oracle for a JUnit test case based on the above information and DEVELOPER COMMENTS of the method to test its functionality.

In the following the test case, replace the `{{ assertion_placeholder }}` with an appropriate assertion:
```
{{ test_method_code }}
```
Just write the assertion statement for the placeholder, not the whole test. No explanation or markdown formatting/tick needed.
