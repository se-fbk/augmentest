    A Java project includes a class called `{{ class_name }}`. 
    We need a test oracle for a JUnit test case based on the information you can find in the provided files and DEVELOPER COMMENTS of the method to test its functionality.
    In the following the test case, replace the `{{ assertion_placeholder }}` with an appropriate and correct assertion:
    ```
    {{ test_method_code }}
    ```
    Just write the assertion statement for the placeholder, not the whole test. Your statement should end with a semicolon. No explanation or markdown formatting/tick needed.
